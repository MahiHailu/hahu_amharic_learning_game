## Reflection
HaHu was a challenging yet rewarding project that allowed me to explore various aspects of game development and language learning. One of the technical challenges I faced was designing an efficient algorithm for generating randomized Amharic letters while ensuring a smooth user experience. Through meticulous planning and testing, I was able to overcome this challenge and create a seamless gameplay experience.

In the next iteration of HaHu, I envision incorporating additional features such as audio pronunciation guides, customizable difficulty levels, and multiplayer modes to enhance user engagement and learning outcomes. Overall, this project has taught me valuable lessons in software development, problem-solving, and user experience design, and I look forward to applying these skills to future projects.
